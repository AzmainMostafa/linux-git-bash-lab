-  Using Git for version control
-  Pushing my first project to GitHub

##  Tools Used

##  Project Files
- `first.txt` – my first file created via terminal

##  What's Next
I'm continuing to build real-world cybersecurity skills through hands-on labs and GitHub projects.

My next project is  **Project_2: Networking and Nmap Basics**!
